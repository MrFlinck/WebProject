his License will terminate automatically
		if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
		compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
		Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
		Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
		ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
		non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
		come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
		Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
		notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
		first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
		from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
		Your receipt of the notice.

		<p>
		5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
		infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
		counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
		directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
		You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
		2.1 of this License shall terminate.
		</p>
		<p> 
		end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
		have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
		prior to termination shall survive termination.
