pecific lines or functions within a file.
Hashtables must contain a Path key (which can be abbreviated to just "P"), and may contain Function (or "F"), StartLine (or "S"), and EndLine ("E") keys to narrow down the commands to be analyzed.
If Function is specified, StartLine and EndLine are ignored.
If only StartLine is defined, the entire script file starting with StartLine is analyzed.
If only EndLine is present, all lines in the script file up to and including EndLine are analyzed.
Both Function and Path (as well as simple strings passed instead of hashtables) may contain wildcards.
